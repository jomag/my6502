# My 6502

I started watching [Ben Eaters](https://eater.net) [video series](https://eater.net/8bit)
where he builds a 6502 (actually, 65C02) based 8-bit computer from scratch
on breadboards. I thought it could be fun to follow along and build something similar,
but using real PCB's cause breadboards drive me crazy.

It might end up being something pretty to hang on the wall...
